# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We recommend always using the latest version of Ivy Framework to ensure you have the most recent security patches and improvements.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Ivy Framework seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred):
   - Navigate to the [Security tab](https://github.com/Ivy-Interactive/Ivy-Framework/security) in this repository
   - Click on "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the security advisory form with details about the vulnerability

2. **Email** (Alternative):
   - Contact the maintainers directly through the contact information provided in the repository

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations (if available)
- Your contact information (optional, but helpful for follow-up questions)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 7 days
- **Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress in addressing the vulnerability
- **Resolution**: We will work to resolve critical vulnerabilities as quickly as possible

### Disclosure Policy

We follow a coordinated disclosure process:

1. We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly
2. We will not disclose the vulnerability publicly until a fix is available
3. Once a fix is ready, we will release it and credit you (if desired) for the discovery
4. We will publish a security advisory through GitHub Security Advisories

### Scope

This security policy applies to:

- The Ivy Framework core library
- Official Ivy Framework widgets and components
- Authentication providers and integrations
- Database connectors and data providers
- The Ivy CLI tool

### Out of Scope

The following are generally considered out of scope:

- Issues in third-party dependencies (please report these to the respective maintainers)
- Issues in applications built with Ivy Framework (these should be reported to the application maintainers)
- Social engineering attacks
- Denial of service attacks
- Issues requiring physical access to a user's device

### Security Best Practices

When using Ivy Framework:

- Always use the latest version
- Keep your dependencies up to date
- Follow secure coding practices as outlined in our [documentation](https://docs.ivy.app)
- Review and understand the security implications of authentication providers you use
- Regularly audit your application's security configuration

## Security Features

Ivy Framework is built with security in mind:

- **Server-side state management**: Minimizes risk of secrets leakage
- **Handcrafted authentication integrations**: All authentication providers are audited
- **Enterprise security constraints**: Built around strict security requirements
- **Secrets management**: Secure handling of sensitive configuration
